UnrealEngine is one of most popular game engines. It's a 3d graphic powerhorse, delivering next-gen graphics. It's greatest feature is probably the Editor, wichich is packed with features and allows creative teams not only efficiently build games but also script with a friendly visual programming language. The editor is open-source, and allows adding custom blueprints (for visual programming) with C++. Programming C++ might be dauditng at first though, as the codebase is huge and not very well documented.

TouchDesigner is awonderfully feature-packed software package, serving as media server and also graphics / audio creative software. It's packed with a lot of media and protocol supports, allows to do a lot with visual basec coding, script in Python, write custom nodes in C++.
